  <p> I started playing violin when I was 8 when I started playing Violin. I went to learn at a place called Stage one Music. There they taught me the posture to hold the Violin how much pressure I should put on it. Then I started loving the instrument. This year I became a 6th grader and am now going to Valley View Middle School. In Middle school you have to choose an Elective and I chose Orchestra. So I am going to two different classes and in both I play Violin. The classes are not all that different. When I am at home I practice songs and have recitals.
